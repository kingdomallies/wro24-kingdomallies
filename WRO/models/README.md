Models

This directory contains all the models used for our robot. Since our robot is made out of LEGO technic pieces, we are going to be 3d printing mounts and adapters for the electronics. Below is a table of our 3D-printed parts and what they are used for.

| File Name | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| CAD 2NS Gear MODEL.stl | To solve the problem of transferring the power from the 6V motors to the LEGO axles, we designed and 3D printed a gear that is mounted on the motor's shaft and meshes with the LEGO differential. We had to create our own gear because the motors have a 3mm D-shaped insert which differs from a plus-shaped LEGO axle. 
| CAD 2ND GEAR MODEL.stl | With motor stability being a crucial part of our drivetrain, we needed to create our own mount to properly secure the motors to our chassis. This helps with our robot's balance and evens out the centre of gravity by allowing us to place one motor on opposite sides.
| KING_FE.io | This file consists of the different materials used to construct our robot. It includes the building instructions. Our team created this model and instruction to allow easy replication of our robot if needed.
