### Who We Are
Kingdom Allies is a driven group of high school students with the ambition to become future leaders in the field of autonomous vehicles. By actively participating in the WRO Future Engineers challenge, we are seizing the opportunity to develop our skills in engineering and problem-solving, preparing ourselves for the innovations of tomorrow.
- Deepen our understanding of autonomous vehicle technology.
- Gain hands-on experience with software organization tools, such as GitHub.
- Develop proficiency in working with electronic components.
- Learn to collaborate effectively as a team, solving problems with innovation and creativity.


### Electrical Components
Our chassis is controlled by the Arduino Nano microcontroller, which gets information from various sensors and uses said information to control the motors using an L298N motor controller board. The sensors that we are using for our vehicle are the following:
- Pixycam 2.1
- L3G4200D 3-Axis Gyro

We utilize the Pixycam 2.1 to detect obstacle locations and navigate around them efficiently. Additionally, we employ the L3G4200D gyroscope to determine the robotâ€™s orientation. For more detailed information about our robot's electrical components, please refer to the README file located in the electrical folder."# wro24-kingdomallies"
